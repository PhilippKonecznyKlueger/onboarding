# This is a simple example program

### The Service is implemented with two profiles

- one for production where everything works as usual
- one mocked profile where the result of the function is mocked

to set the profile edit the run configurations left to the start button

the Instance has to be set null at compile time and gets it's Instance of the actual profile set at runtime

### to test the endpoints a swagger ui is included
